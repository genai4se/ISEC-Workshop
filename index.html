                       The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) governs the creation of software systems, encompassing 
                       various engineering phases such as requirement specification, design, coding, testing, and maintenance. 
                       Software development is an effort-intensive and time-consuming activity whereas systems today need to 
                       reflect changes as quickly as possible. Most complex, large-scale software systems of today derive their 
                       requirements from existing (legacy) software and partial (incomplete) descriptions. Software
                       development is thus a complex combination of transformation, reverse and forward engineering, 
                       involving code, data, and specifications, where data is both structured and unstructured. Expertise from 
                       subject matter specialists (SMEs) is essential at each phase, which brings in the important component of 
                       knowledge. While Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), Knowledge Engineering (KE), and Reverse 
                       Engineering (RE) have mitigated some of the challenges, the emergence of Generative AI techniques holds 
                       the potential for a substantial breakthrough. These techniques empower SMEs to construct purposeful 
                       engineering artifacts using natural language interactions.
                           </p>-->
                   <p>
                       The proposed workshop aims to provide a collaborative platform for researchers and practitioners to 
                       delve into the convergence of traditional MDE, KE, and RE methodologies together with Generative AI 
                       technologies. By synergizing the strengths of Gen AI, modeling, and knowledge representation for SDLC,
                       our goal is to define a trajectory toward enhanced software engineering practices. We seek discussion on
                       the following pivotal questions:
                   </p>
                    <p>
                   <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
                   <ul>
                   <li> The development of industry-strength software is a multi-skill, long-drawn activity that cannot 
                       be effectively addressed by LLMs alone. What’s the right augmentation required? </li>
                       <li> LLM is a vast storehouse of general information, but the typical need during software 
                           development is rather sharply focused. How best to bear local knowledge to get the required 
                           focus? </li>
                       <li> Should one have to go to LLM every time and be vulnerable to its limitations?</li>
                       <li> Is fine-tuning LLM the only way, or purposive knowledge representation can perform far better 
                           at times?</li>
                       <li>Can Generative AI play a role in constructing purpose-driven knowledge representations?</li>
                       <li>Can and how does Generative AI enhance the program analysis-driven techniques for 
                           understanding programs?</li>
                       <li>How can Generative AI catalyze legacy modernization in a compelling manner?</li>
                       <li>How does Generative AI outshine other natural language processing techniques in software 
                           engineering contexts?</li>
                       </ul>

                   <!--<P>The workshop will foster interactive discussions, enabling participants to collectively shape the future 
                       of advanced software engineering. The inaugural edition will concentrate on charting directions for 
                       further research and development. The insights garnered from these discussions will be potentially 
                       synthesized into a comprehensive publication. Going beyond a singular event, we propose to establish 
                       this workshop as a recurring forum within ISEC, aiming to expedite progress along multiple dimensions, 
                       facilitating the evolution of software engineering practices that align seamlessly with the dynamic
